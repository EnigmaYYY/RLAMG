She is in a room with one door which is locked at the start of the puzzle. The room contains $n$ light switches, each of which is initially off. Each minute, she must flip exactly $k$ different light switches (to \"flip\" a switch means to turn it on if it is currently off, and off if it is currently on). At the end of each minute, if all of the switches are on, then the door unlocks and Elizabeth escapes from the room.\n\nLet $E(n, k)$ be the minimum number of minutes required for Elizabeth to escape, for positive integers $n, k$ with $k \\leq n$. For example, $E(2,1)=2$ because Elizabeth cannot escape in one minute (there are two switches and one must be flipped every minute) but she can escape in two minutes (by flipping Switch 1 in the first minute and Switch 2 in the second minute). Define $E(n, k)=\\infty$ if the puzzle is impossible to solve (that is, if it is impossible to have all switches on at the end of any minute).\n\nFor convenience, assume the $n$ light switches are numbered 1 through $n$.\nCompute the $E(9,5)$\nassistant\n", "To determine the minimum number of minutes \\( E(9, 5) \\) required for Elizabeth to escape the room, we need to find the shortest sequence of operations (flipping switches) that will turn all switches on. Let's analyze the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, note that each minute, Elizabeth flips exactly 5 switches. The total number of switches is 9, so after 9 minutes, she would flip \\( 9 \\times 5 = 45 \\) switches. However, since there are only 9 switches, she will flip each switch multiple times. We need to find a sequence of switch flips that will turn all 9 switches on.\n\nConsider the following strategy: flip switches in a pattern that ensures each switch is flipped an even number of times. This is because if a switch is flipped an odd number of times, it will be on at the end of the minute, and if it is flipped an even number of times, it will be off at the end of the minute. Since we need all switches to be on, we should flip each switch an even number of times.\n\nOne possible sequence of switch flips is to flip switches in the following pattern: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, ...). This sequence ensures that each switch is flipped an even number of times. Let's verify this:\n\n- After the first minute, switches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are on.\n- After the second minute, switches 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 are on.\n- After the third minute, switches 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are on.\n- After the fourth minute, switches 1, 7, 8, 9, 2 are on.\n- After the fifth minute, switches 6, 8, 9, 3, 4 are on.\n- After the sixth minute, switches 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 are on.\n- After the seventh minute, switches 6, 7, 9, 4, 5 are on.\n- After the eighth minute, switches 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are on.\n- After the ninth minute, switches 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 are on.\n- After the tenth minute, switches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are on.\n\nAt the end of the tenth minute, all switches are on.
